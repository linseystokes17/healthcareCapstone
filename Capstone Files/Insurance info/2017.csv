"Notes"
"The majority of our health coverage topics are based on analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) by KFF. ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population and allows for precise state-level estimates.   "
""
"The ACS asks respondents about their health insurance coverage at the time of the survey. Respondents may report having more than one type of coverage; however, individuals are sorted into only one category of insurance coverage. See definitions for more detail on coverage type."
""
"* The count of people with Medicare excludes those who report having both Medicare and Medicaid coverage, also known as dual eligibles. If these individuals were instead categorized as having Medicare, the total number of people with Medicare would increase as follows:"
"     - 2019: from 45,286,700 to 56,182,200"
"     - 2018: from 43,837,300 to 54,685,100"

"     - 2016: from 41,628,600 to 52,099,100"
"     - 2015: from 40,558,200 to 50,747,800"
"     - 2014: from 39,364,700 to 49,231,400"
